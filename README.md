# SLR_WeightAndCostofTreatment
* This dataset contains Body Weight and Treatment Costs of 120 Patients.
* The goal: predict the cost incurred by the patients based on their body weights

**Variable details**:
* BodyWeight: Weight of Patients in kilograms(kg)
* Cost of Treatments: Cost incurred by the Patients in the hospital

**Beside using a SLR model, I also perform the log tranformatio on the model to increase the model accuracy (r-squared).**

## Findings
* All the models return low r-squared score.
* Log-transformation is proved to increase the r-squared score.
